Compile instructions:
Please do this in a linux environment (Used Ubuntu for development) 
2 ways to compile this program. 
Simple bash script to just run the same command but either work equally well. 
Using the command line (and in the same directory as the project files), do either one of the following: 
--> 1. ./buildWC.sh 
--> 2. javac WebCrawler.java 

This'll produce a WebCrawler.class (the most recent compilation already included but may be deleted since this'll produce a new one). 
From there, I included some sample runs (3 executions with varying number of hops). 

To run the sample one (also a bash script), do ./sample_run.sh in the same terminal

Or to run your own website urls, please do 'java http://(your url).com (your number of hops)'
Program is made to take only http links so include http in the overall URL please.
