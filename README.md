# StartingProjs
Repo meant to hold projects to start familiarizing with a certain topic of programming (E.g APIs, Networking, Playing around with a specific language, etc.)
Essentially my playground to explore new topics, build on old projects, possibly school assignments, and more. 
Any suggestions to existing projects or need clarification on some programs, please feel free to ask. I'm more strict on commenting and documentation when it's for something more official so I might have some lapses of explanations. 
Any suggestions for ideas/topics for me to explore new aspects of programming or things you found really cool and think I should check out, please contact me on here or email at jkang18@uw.edu. ~Thanks
