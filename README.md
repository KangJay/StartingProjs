# StartingProjs
Repo meant to hold projects to start familiarizing with a certain topic of programming (E.g APIs, Networking, Playing around with a specific language, etc.)
Essentially my playground to explore new topics, build on old projects, possibly school assignments, and more. 
Any suggestions for ideas/topics for me to explore new aspects of programming or things you found really cool and think I should check out, please contact me on here or email at jkang18@uw.edu. ~Thanks
