Compile instructions:
Please do this in a linux environment (Used Ubuntu for development) 
2 ways to compile this program. 
Simple bash script to just run the same command but either work equally well. 
Please make sure the following files are also in the same directory/folder: 'build.sh', 'HowToBuild'(this file), 'WeatherGetter.java'.

Using the command line (and in the same directory as the project files), do either one of the following: 
--> 1. ./build.sh 
--> 2. javac WeatherGetter.java 

This'll produce 'WeatherGetter.class' (the most recent compilation already included but can be deleted since this'll produce a new one).
